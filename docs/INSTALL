5 easy steps for a successful Adaptive Website Framework (AWF) installation:

1) Untar the archive (should be awf-1.XX.tar.gz or something) 
in the directory of your choice. The http server (normally Apache) 
should  have read AND write access (if you don't know how to do this, 
try "man chmod", "man chgrp" and "man chown").

2) PHP 4.00 (or better) and an installed MySQL server are required. 
For security reasons, I recommend PHP 4.06 or any later version.

3) If not yet done, create an user with read/write permissions and 
a database (CREATE DATABASE [name]) in MySQL. If you need help, have a look
at http://www.mysql.com/.

4) If not yet done, start your webserver and verify, that you can connect ;)

5) Than you can continue using the PHP script SETUP.PHP (in most cases 
http://www.domain.com/admin/setup.php).

That's all.

AWF should then be available at http://www.domain.com/index.php. The initial default 
users are "a" and "b" (passwords are "a" and "b" too). "a" is editor and "b" normal 
user. Changes can be made using the User Management script (/admin/users.php).

Please don't forget to protect the directories admin, cache, inc and 
users with .htaccess files!

You can distribute AWF as free software, according to the 
GNU General Public License (Version 2).

If you want to contact me, have a look at the file AUTHORS. Some help in development
of new versions and designs would be nice. 

take care and have fun,
