Hi Gunnvald,
 
thanks for your feedback. This version of AWF was the initial public
release. Depending on how much downloads we have, there will me more
support (English docs, forum, cvs, mailing list,...) in the next weeks. As
a reaction to a user request we already released a PS version of the
German documentation - which will also be improved in the next time.
 
If that's ok, I will publish this mail in the public awf directory on our
server.
